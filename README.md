# Learning-Vagrant

![Vagrant](http://tech.osteel.me/images/2015/01/25/vagrant.png)
<br/>Vagrant allows you rapidly provision a fully functioning VM of your choice having the required dependencies, without having to download the entire image like you do in an actual VM. The VM provisioned can be accessed through command line by ssh'ing into it, once a working copy is built by running **vagrant up** and then **vagrant ssh**. 

- vagrant up
- vagrant reload
- vagrant ssh
- vagrant provision
- vagrant halt
